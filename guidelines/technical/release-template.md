The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

Adherence to this template is recommended for any project on ICON, and required for any of the following code changes to ICON infrastructure:

- New and nontrivial features
- Nontrivial modifications to existing features
- Changes that require coordination among independent parties, such as changes that impact multiple SIGs or multiple SIG projects

## Production Readiness Review

The purpose of a [production readiness review](https://sre.google/sre-book/evolving-sre-engagement-model/#production-readiness-reviews-simple-prr-model-4ksZcY8) is to verify that a major feature addition or modification of a given service meets the accepted documentation, observability, and reliability standards for that service.
