## Licensing

Unless otherwise stated, the ICON Foundation requires open source code. The code must include an MIT license, Apache 2.0, or another license explicitly approved by the ICON Foundation. If you donâ€™t know what to choose, pick the MIT license.

## Deliverables

We value high-quality open source code, but even the most performant code is of little use if it lacks proper documentation.

We require that you document (where applicable):

API calls
Architecture overview and individual component details
Algorithms and protocols that are core to your project
Any other fundamental building blocks to your technology
Unless absolutely necessary, make the documentation public as well, ideally as part of the appropriate code repository. This will make it easier for the community to use or adapt your project.

Note: Only focus on your own contributions. Do not write detailed explanations of already existing components, e.g. IPFS.
