# Governance

The ICON blockchain is decentralized and any party is welcome to establish their own governance structure. The ICON Foundation adopts a similar governance structure to other large open source projects, such as [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community) and [W3C](). We officially support the following types of groups:

## Committees

Each committee is appointed by the ICON Foundation to undertake strategic and sensitive topics. Committees should generally adhere to the [transparency guidelines](/guidelines/communication/communication-guidelines.md#transparency), but may communicate in private when necessary.

## Special interest groups

A special interest group (SIG) is a collaborative group of independent parties that openly contribute and share expertise on a specific technology area.

Check out any of the CONTRIBUTING.md files of existing SIGs in the [special-interest-groups](/special-interest-groups/) folder for more information about how to contribute.

To learn more about proposing a new SIG, see the [SIG proposal process document](/special-interest-groups/sig-proposal-process.md).

### Projects

Each SIG is comprised of independent but related projects that advance the SIG's goals.
