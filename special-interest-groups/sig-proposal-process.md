# Special Interest Group Proposal Process

## Introduction

This document outlines the application process for creating a special interest group (SIG).

## Forming a SIG

SIGs may be formed by a group of ICON Community members or by the steering committee. The steering committee approves the formation of each SIG and periodically reviews the activity of all SIGs to ensure they are fulfilling their mission.

Each ICON SIG must draft a charter following the [charter template](charter-template.md) that defines its scope, deliverables, timeline, governance, and communication methods.

The SIG's charter should be submitted as a pull request that will be approved or rejected by the steering committee members.
