## Intro

This is the repository for the organization of certain resources for the technical developments of the [ICON Project](https://github.com/icon-project). This repository is in active development.

To learn more about the project structure and organization, please refer to [organization and relationships](structure/organization-and-relationships.md) information.

## Structure
ICON has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

- Committees are named sets of people that are chartered to take on sensitive topics. This group is encouraged to be as open as possible while achieving its mission but, because of the nature of the topics discussed, private communications are allowed. Examples of committees include the steering committee and things like security or code of conduct.

- Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project. SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings. Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute provided they follow the Kubernetes Code of Conduct. The purpose of a SIG is to own and develop a set of subprojects.
  - Subprojects Each SIG can have a set of subprojects. These are smaller groups that can work independently. Some subprojects will be part of the main ICON deliverables while others will be more speculative.

- Working Groups are temporary groups that are formed to address issues that cross SIG boundaries. Working groups do not own any code or other long term artifacts. Working groups can report back and act through involved SIGs.

- User Groups are groups for facilitating communication and discovery of information related to topics that have long term relevance to large groups of ICON users. They do not have ownership of parts of the ICON code base.

See the full governance doc for more details on these groups.

A SIG can have its own policy for contribution, described in a README or CONTRIBUTING file in the SIG folder in this repo (e.g. sig-interoperability/CONTRIBUTING.md), and its own mailing list, slack channel, etc.

If you want to edit details about a SIG (e.g. its weekly meeting time or its leads), please follow [these instructions](generator/README.md) that detail how our docs are auto-generated.

### Guidelines

This section includes guidelines for assisting collaborators and grantees to understand how to participate in the ICON ecosystem. Guidelines must be followed as specified by grant agreements or other pertinent contracts. This section maintains guidelines for topics including the following:
