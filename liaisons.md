# Liaisons

Steering Committee members are elected representatives of the Kubernetes
project contributor base. Itâ€™s important that we make sure ensure a good
flow of governance information and feedback loops to and from the 
groups. With over 35 community groups and 100+ leads, it can be hard to 
connect for communitywide consensus and to help with this, each group 
is assigned a Steering Committee liaison. 

Leads may call on liaisons to act as a point of contact from Steering, 
be an advisor for governance or community health matters, and kick
things off and consult throughout the process for [annual reports](committee-steering/governance/annual-reports.md).

Liaisons do not make decisions for the community group or on behalf of
the Steering Committee.

Liaisons are assigned community groups at random (adjustments can be
made, if needed) with each member having an (almost) equal distribution
of SIGs, WGs and UGs. Each year after Steering Committee elections, new 
members will assume one of the departing members groups.
