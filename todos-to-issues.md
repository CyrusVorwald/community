# TODOs to Issues

This repository is currently in the early stages of development and subject to change often. We use https://github.com/alstr/todo-to-issue-action to generate issues from TODOs

### Inline

{/* TODO(header): Create an inline issue labels: enhancement, help wanted assignees: CyrusVorwald-ICON milestone: 1  */}

{/* TODO(header): Create an inline issue labels: enhancement, help wanted assignees: CyrusVorwald-ICON milestone: 1  */}

### Multiline

Adding lines here

{/* 
  TODO: Create a multiline issue
  labels: enhancement, help wanted
  assignees: CyrusVorwald-ICON
  milestone: 1
*/}

### Notes

It seems that you cannot edit issues and that having a TODO in the same lines of code as the last build results in no changes.
