# ICON Community Values

ICON's community culture is the cornerstone of ICON's sustainability. These are the core values of ICON's community culture.

## Community first

We place the highest value on [the common methodology of sustainable open source projects.](https://www.theopensourceway.org/the_open_source_way-guidebook-2.0.html) We invite and encourage users to participate and contribute in the ICON community.

## Inclusive participation

Our community respects the time and effort put into a discussion, regardless of where a contributor is on their growth path. Open communication of both new and researched ideas is key to the success of the ICON project.

## Decentralized leadership

The long-term success and sustainability of the ICON project is only possible as an inclusive meritocracy with decentralization of leadership, funding, development, and documentation.

## Less toil

[Chapter 5 of Google's Site Reliability Engineering handbook](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/) defines toil as "the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows."

In short, things that can be automated ought to be automated. We value the time spent on automation more than the time spent on toil.

## Thoughtful engineering

Taking the time to reduce cruft greatly improves speed of delivery over time. As with all good open source software, the ability for contributors to easily onboard and add value is high impact and high priority.
